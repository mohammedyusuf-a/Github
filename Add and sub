# Simple Addition and Subtraction Program

# Get two numbers from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Ask the user what operation they want
operation = input("Type '+' for addition or '-' for subtraction: ")

# Perform the selected operation
if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
    print("Result:", result)
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
    print("Result:", result)
else:
    print("Invalid operation")
